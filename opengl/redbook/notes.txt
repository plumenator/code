Notes from the OpenGL Programming Guide, 7th Edition.
-----------------------------------------------------
1) OpenGL is 
   - an interface to graphics hardware
   - hardware-independent
   - devoid of any platform specific windowing or user input commands
   
2) There are three kinds of primitives
   - points
   - lines
   - poygons

3) Vertices -> Primitives -> Models -> Image

4) "Information about the pixels (for instance, what color they¡¯re supposed to
   be) is organized in memory into bitplanes. A bitplane is an area of memory
   that holds one bit of information for every pixel on the screen; the bit might
   indicate how red a particular pixel is supposed to be, for example. The
   bitplanes are themselves organized into a framebuffer, which holds all the
   information that the graphics display needs to control the color and
   intensity of all the pixels on the screen."
